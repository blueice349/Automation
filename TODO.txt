TODO list: 


Delta is not present in API, I add manually one each iterarion.

When the action is "delete", the API should also provide the phones relationed to the table.
account_nid is not present in the results for contact.json (I am relating every row to account_nid == 0)
The system is working in such a way that when a contact is deleted the account (related row) is gonna remain in the system, but when account is deleted, contacts (referenced row) gets deleted as well.
If a vocabulary is deleted the terms related to it also are deleted together.
If a term is deleted the value 0 is attributed to field_phone.type_id (Managed by triggers) 




Implement:

When app is executed for the first time create the taxonomy
